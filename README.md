# Time Series Classification

* In this project I have developed a Time Series classification model based on Fourier Transform. I have used three classifiers Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Neighourest Neighbour. After that I have compared their performances using scatter plots.

* The datasets used to make the models are present [here](/datasets/readme.md)

## Results

* [Results](/results.csv)

* These results show the error values each model has with the corresponding dataset.

* The three classifiers used are:
- Nearest Neighbour(ed)
- Random Forest(rf)
- Logistic Regression(lr)

* All three classifier are used with the following three values derived from fourier transform of orignal dataset:
- Phase and Amplitude(phase_amp)
- Real and Imaginary values(real_imag)
- Phase, Amplitude, Real and Imaginary values(real_imag_phase_amp)
